//In JavaScript, the thing called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript
// code. The value of this, when used in a function, is the object that "owns" the
// function. The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.
//The this keyword in an object constructor does not have a value. It is only a
// substitute for the new object.     The value of this will become the new object
// when the constructor is used to create an object.
//binding er explicit

//JAVA og this
//binding er implicit
//Within an instance method or a constructor, this is a reference to the current object
//â€” the object whose method or constructor is being called. You can refer to any member
// of the current object from within an instance method or a constructor by using this.

//why we uset var self = this; in third semester<.
//self is being used to maintain a reference to the original this even as the context is
// changing. It's a technique often used in event handlers (especially in closures).

//purpose of methods call(), apply(), bind()
    //apply (der tager en et array af argumenter) og call (der tager en liste af argumenter) er metoder til explicit binding
